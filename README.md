Nothing too exciting here just yet. Some small experiments I've been working on to build up to algorithmic composition using RNNs and largely-unsupervised learning directly from waveform training data.

Likely to be a fool's errand.

Currently consists of:
* A iPython notebook prototyping out some FFT transforms and MEL visualizations.
* A C# project that captures the Windows audio loopback device and allows you to easily annotate music you're listening to with beat onsets to build up a respectable training set.
